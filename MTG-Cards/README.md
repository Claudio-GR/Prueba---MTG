This project was created for a test in a developers bootcamp called "Desarrollo Full Stack Javascript" in Desafio LATAM.
For this time I'm pressenting my project for the first React course.
In this project I've used an API related to the trading card game Magic the Gathering.
If you want to understand better this project please check the following video:
